The new model is calibrated through an artificial intelligence-based optimization process based on a hybrid dataset, including both experimental data from real tests and numerical simulations from a refined FE micro-models realized in Abaqus environment. The new model takes into account the effect of vertical loads, the slenderness ratio and the aspect ratio of the infill and also introduces a specific conversion factor to uniformize the results from point-load and uniform load out-of-plane tests.

The implementation of these interventions is generally associated with noticeable costs, significant downtime, and relevant invasiveness. Despite the vast variety of efficient retrofitting interventions available, the design of retrofitting interventions in masonry structures is not straightforward, as the reinforcement techniques can significantly change strength but also stiffness, and masses. This can lead to recursive design issues that are mainly tackled with several trial-and-error attempts and engineers’ intuition. This paper presents a novel optimization framework aimed at the minimization of seismic retrofitting-related costs by pinpointing the optimal position (topological optimization) of glass-fibers (GFRP) reinforced plasters in masonry structures. In the proposed framework a 3D masonry model implemented in OpenSees is handled by the proposed genetic algorithm developed in MATLAB®. The metaheuristic procedure allows obtaining the optimal solution without the need of evaluating all the possible solutions that could involve huge computational effort. The characteristics of each tentative solution are encoded on a design vector of Booleans representing the position of reinforced walls inside the structure. The fitness of each solution is evaluated through an objective function that estimates the intervention costs indirectly calculating the area of GFRP implemented. The optimal solution is searched by selecting the best individuals of each generation through a tournament selection and mixing their design vector with the crossover genetic operator. In order to prevent stacks into local minima, the mutation operator is involved to introduce modest random alterations of the genes. The feasibility of each configuration is controlled by flexural and shear safety checks of masonry walls. The possible unfeasibilities are taken into account in the procedure with a penalty function that increases fictitiously the fitness according to the size of walls that do not achieve the safety checks. The routine is stopped when the cost is minimized, namely when no further cost reductions are obtained from subsequent generations. The framework is tested with a real case study structure, showing the suitability of the algorithm to provide cost-effective retrofitting solutions. The proposed algorithm can be an efficient support to engineers in the preliminary design of seismic retrofitting, allowing effortless identification of optimal solutions with a significant reduction in implementation costs that allows better management of funds allocated in seismic retrofitting of earthquake-prone areas building heritage.","tags":["structural optimization","existing structures","seismic retrofitting","genetic algorithms","masonry structures","CRM","OpenSees","non-linear static analyses"],"title":"Genetic algorithm-based optimization procedure for the seismic retrofitting of existing masonry structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Di Trapani Fabio","Bogatkina Valentina","Di Benedetto Marilisa","Antonio P.

The force increment is transferred to the RC frame column ends as an additional shear force, potentially causing local shear failures at the end of the columns. The additional shear demand due to masonry infills cannot be evaluated by the common equivalent strut models. On the other hand, refined finite element models are not computationally effective to be used in practice. With the aim to maintain the simplicity of the equivalent strut approach with-out losing the information about the actual shear force on the columns, this paper presents a detailed study about the infill-frame shear transfer mechanism. Refined 2D nonlinear models of real experimental tests on infilled frames have been de-fined using the OpenSees / STKO software platform. Shear demands on the columns are extracted by integrating the nodal forces at specific section cuts of the RC members. The same simulations are made using the equivalent strut approach. An analytical relationship if finally proposed to estimate the additional shear demand at the ends of the columns. The latter relates the  additional shear demand to the current axial force on the equivalent struts and the geometrical and mechanical properties of the infilled frames. The formula can be easily implemented to perform shear safety checks at the columns ends when performing seismic assessments.","tags":["masonry infills","concrete structures","local effect","OpenSees","non-linear static analyses"],"title":"Simplified Evaluation of the Additional Shear Demand Due to Masonry Infills","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Image by Pexels from Pixabay This is just a container place where I collect ideas and notes about things I know little about but that I would like to deepen.\nNext posts that I will (probably) write and publish here:\nConfinement of concrete Resolution of 2D frame structures with MatLab ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"9d904755d9b4f4352ba2a8689a02bd4e","permalink":"https://AntonioSberna.github.io/ideasabout/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ideasabout/","section":"","summary":"This is just a container place where I collect ideas and notes about things I know little about but that I would like to deepen.","tags":null,"title":"Ideas about ...","type":"page"},{"authors":["Antonio P.

The algorithm focuses on the minimization of retrofitting intervention costs of reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures. The feasibility of each tentative solution is assessed by considering in an indirect way the expected annual loss (EAL), this evaluation is performed by referring to different limit states whose repairing costs are expressed as a percentage of reconstruction costs and evaluating the respective mean annual frequency of exceedance. As the EAL takes into account the overall structural performances, to involves both serviceability and ultimate limit states, two different seismic retrofitting techniques are considered. In particular, FRP wrapping of columns is employed to increase the ductility of RC elements managing life safety and collapse limit state demands. On the other hand, steel bracings are used to increase the global stiffness of the structure and mainly increase operational and damage limit states performances. The optimization procedure is carried out by the novel genetic algorithm-based framework developed in Matlab® that is connected to a 3D RC frame fiber-section model implemented in OpenSees. For both the retrofitting systems, the algorithm provides their position within the structure (topological optimization) and their sizing. Results will show that seismic retrofitting can be effectively designed to increase the overall structural safety by efficaciously optimizing the intervention costs.","tags":["structural optimization","existing structures","seismic retrofitting","Expected Annual Losses","genetic algorithms","concrete structures","FRP","steel braces","OpenSees","non-linear static analyses"],"title":"Cost and EAL based optimization for seismic reinforcement of RC structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Di Trapani Fabio","Antonio P.

This paper presents two frameworks for the engineered optimization of the seismic retrofitting for reinforced concrete buildings. The first one is directed at minimizing the intervention costs; the second one instead is based on the assessment of the expected annual loss.  Both applications are based on a genetic algorithm developed in MatLab that aims to characterize the optimal solution in terms of retrofitting position (topological optimization) and amount (sizing optimization). In both cases, the feasibility of each tentative solution is controlled by a static pushover analysis in the framework of the N2 method, achieved by a 3D fiber-section model realized in OpenSees. It is also shown, through different case studies, that the proposed methodologies are efficient to find optimal retrofitting configurations, significantly reducing invasiveness and downtime.","tags":["structural optimization","existing structures","seismic retrofitting","Expected Annual Losses","genetic algorithms","concrete structures","FRP","steel braces","OpenSees","non-linear static analyses"],"title":"Cost-based and EAL based optimization algorithms for seismic retrofitting of RC frame structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Di Trapani Fabio","Malavisi Marzia","Antonio P.
