Steel-jacketing (SJ) effectively provides additional deformation and strength capacity to RC members but its application is associated with noticeable downtime of the building and non-negligible costs, depending on the amount of structural and non-structural manufacturing and materials. This paper presents an optimization framework aimed at the minimization of seismic retrofitting-related costs by an optimal placement (topological optimization) and amount of steel-jacketing reinforcement. In the proposed framework a 3D RC frame fiber-section model implemented in OpenSees is handled by a genetic algorithm routine that iterates reinforcement configurations to match the optimal solution. The feasibility of each solution is controlled by the outcomes of a static pushover analysis in the framework of N2 method. Results will provide optimized location and amount of steel-jacketing reinforcement, showing how effective and sustainable reduction of retrofitting costs is achievable maintaining a specified safety level.\n","date":1590361201,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590361201,"objectID":"1093a444541e17875af54ca861495d10","permalink":"https://AntonioSberna.github.io/publication/ga-sj/","publishdate":"2020-05-25T00:00:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ga-sj/","section":"publication","summary":"A new framework for the optimization of steel jacketing retrofitting interventions on RC columns","tags":[],"title":"Optimal seismic retrofitting of reinforced concrete buildings by steel-jacketing using a genetic algorithm-based framework","type":"publication"}]
